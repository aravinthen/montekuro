# MonteKuro
Experiments with Monte Carlo simulations for fun and profit, following *Understanding Molecular Simulations* by Frenkel and Smit.

Kuro is my cat.

## Program structure
The code is intended to be as modular as possible.

## Running instructions
Running is relatively self-contained. Have a look at the examples file for the simulation that you wish to run: if you have a simulation in mind, make your own example. Keep the name of your example file in mind!

Then, edit `makefile` by replacing the `FILE` name with the name of the example file you wish to compile.

Compile using the `make` command and your Monte Carlo simulation will await you as an executable program with the same name as the example file.
